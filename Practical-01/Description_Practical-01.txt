Task 1 - Run all four compilation units individually for any sample program using C++.

There are 4 main stages involved in creating an executable file from the source file.

    1. The C++ the preprocessor takes a C++ source code file and deals with the headers(#include), macros(#define) and other preprocessor directives.

    2. The expanded C++ source code file produced by the C++ preprocessor is compiled into the assembly language for the platform.

    3. The assembler code generated by the compiler is assembled into the object code for the platform.

    4. The object code file produced by the assembler is linked together
    with the object code files for any library functions used to produce either a library or an executable file.
